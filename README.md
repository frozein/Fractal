# Multibrot-Viewer

A simple realtime renderer for viewing the mandelbrot set fractal as well as it other powers (multibrot fractals). It runs on compute shaders in openGL and is customizable using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). It is capable of zooming in to around 100,000x before precision becomes an issue. This is just a hobby project I made in a few hours, so there are no plans to expand it.
